     C - O

1 * C = 4
1 * O = 6
	-----
	   10 valence electrons
	    2 bonding electrons used so far
	-----
	    8 electrons remain

C needs 6 more electrons
give 6 electrons to C, give remaining 2 electrons to O

	..
	:C - O:
	..
	
O still needs 4 more electrons
make C-O bond a double bond

	..
	C = O:
	..

C has 8 electrons, O has 6 electrons
make C=O bond a triple bond

	
	:C â‰¡ O:
	
C has 8 electrons, O has 8 electrons
done.

2. Assign electrons naively

O2 still needs 4 more electrons
options
	a. give O2 2 from C
	b. share 2 between C and O2
	c. give O2 2 from O1

C now needs 2					C needs 2			O1 and O2 each need 2 more
options
	share 2 between O1 and C

share 2 between O1 and C
